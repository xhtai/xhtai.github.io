---
## Recap
--

- Exploratory data analysis
  - Manipulate or transform the data before visualizing or calculating summary statistics

- Data manipulation tools 

  - `select()`
  
  - `arrange()`
  
  - `slice()`
  
  - `filter()`

---
## Today
- Data manipulation tools 

  - `distinct()`: filter for unique rows
  
  - `mutate()`: adds new variables
  
  - `summarize()`: reduces variables to values
  
  - `group_by()`: for grouped operations

- Data visualization using `ggplot2`  

---

## Data: Hotel bookings

- Data from two hotels: one resort and one city hotel

- **Observations**: Each **row** represents a hotel booking

- **Goal** for original data collection: Development of prediction models to classify a hotel booking's likelihood to be cancelled ([Antonia et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#bib5))

```{r message=FALSE}
hotels <- readr::read_csv("data/hotels.csv")
```

.footnote[
Source: [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md)
]


---

## First question: What is in the data set?

.tiny[
```{r output.lines=18}
dplyr::glimpse(hotels)
```
]

---
## `distinct()` to filter for unique rows

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(market_segment) 
```
]

.pull-left[
Recall: `arrange()` to order alphabetically
```{r}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(market_segment) %>%
  arrange(market_segment)
```
]
]

---
## `distinct()` using more than one variable 
```{r output.lines=13}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(hotel, market_segment) %>% #<<
  arrange(hotel, market_segment)
```


---
## `mutate()` to add a new variable

```{r}
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>% 
  select(children, babies, little_ones) %>%
  arrange(desc(little_ones))
```

<small>What are these functions doing? How do to the same in base R?</small>

---

## `count()` to create frequency tables

.pull-left[
```{r}
# alphabetical order by default
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
# descending frequency order
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment, 
        sort = TRUE) #<<
```
]

- Base R version: `table()`

---

## `count()` and `arrange()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
# ascending frequency order
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) %>%
  arrange(n) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# descending frequency order
# just like adding sort = TRUE
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) #<<
```
]

---

## `count()` for multiple variables

```{r}
hotels %>%
  count(hotel, market_segment) 
```

---

## `summarize()` for summary stats

```{r}
# mean average daily rate for all bookings
hotels %>%
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr)) 
```

- `summarize()` **changes the data frame** entirely

- **Rows are collapsed** into a single summary statistic

- **Columns that are irrelevant** to the calculation are **removed**


---
## `summarize()` is often used with `group_by()`

- For **grouped operations**

- There are **two types** of `hotel`, city and resort hotels

- We want the mean daily rate for bookings at **city vs. resort** hotels

```{r}
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>% 
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr))
```

- `group_by()` can be used with **more than one group**

---

## Multiple summary statistics

`summarize` can be used for multiple summary statistics as well

```{r}
hotels %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(), # frequencies
    min_adr = min(adr),
    mean_adr = mean(adr),
    median_adr = median(adr),
    max_adr = max(adr)
    )
```

---
## Data manipulation using `dplyr`

.pull-left[
```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarize`: reduce variables to values
- `group_by`: for grouped operations
- ... (many more)
]
]

## Exercise: NYC Flights data
This data frame contains data on all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013. It is available as part of the `dplyr` package. 

```{r}
nycflights13::flights
```


---
## Exercise: NYC Flights data

Select the `carrier` column.

Select the `carrier` and `tailnum` columns.

Sort the data by origin.

Filter only flights with carrier `OO`.

Filter only flights with carrier `OO`, originating in `LGA`.

Create a new variable that indicates whether or not the flight departed late. 

Create a new variable for the mean departure delay by day.
```{r include = FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(meanDepDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Repeat all the operations using base R. 

---
## Data visualization using `ggplot2` 

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot2-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
] 
.pull-right[ 
- ggplot2 is the tidyverse's **data visualization package** 

- `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics 

- Inspired by the book Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson

- We will also look at some **plotting functions in base R**  
]

## `ggplot2` vs. base R
Mass vs. height from Star Wars data set that we've seen 

.tiny[
.pull-left[
```{r , fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", 
       y = "Weight (kg)")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r , fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%"}
plot(starwars$height, starwars$mass, 
     main = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
     xlab = "Height (cm)", 
     ylab = "Weight (kg)")
```
]
]

---

## Grammar of Graphics

.pull-left-narrow[
A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the **components of a graphic**
]
.pull-right-wide[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/grammar-of-graphics.png")
```
]

How these are implemented in `ggplot2`: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

.footnote[ Source: [BloggoType](http://bloggotype.blogspot.com/2016/08/holiday-notes2-grammar-of-graphics.html)]

---

## Mass vs. height from Star Wars data set 

```{r mass-height, fig.width = 8, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")
```

---

## Mass vs. height from Star Wars data set 

```{r ref.label="mass-height", fig.show = "hide"}
```

- What are the functions doing the plotting?

- What is the data set being plotted?

- Which variables map to which features (aesthetics) of the plot?

- What does the warning mean?


---

## ggplot2

- `ggplot()` is the **main function** in the `ggplot2` package

- Plots are constructed in **layers**

- **Structure of the code** for plots can be summarized as

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```
