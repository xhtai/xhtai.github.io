## Data: Hotel bookings

- Data from two hotels: one resort and one city hotel

- **Observations**: Each **row** represents a hotel booking

- **Goal** for original data collection: Development of prediction models to classify a hotel booking's likelihood to be cancelled ([Antonia et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#bib5))

```{r message=FALSE}
hotels <- readr::read_csv("data/hotels.csv")
```

## First question: What is in the data set?

.tiny[
```{r output.lines=18}
dplyr::glimpse(hotels)
```
]

---

## `select()`: Select a single column

View only `lead_time` (number of days between booking and arrival date):

```{r}
select(hotels, lead_time)
```

- **First argument**: data frame we're working with , `hotels`
- **Second argument**: variable we want to select, `lead_time`
- **Result**: data frame with `r nrow(hotels)` rows and 1 column
- This is an alternative to `hotels$lead_time`
---

## Select multiple columns

View only the `hotel` type and `lead_time` columns:


```{r}
select(hotels, hotel, lead_time)
```

---
## `select()` to exclude variables

- We saw earlier that `select()` keeps variables
- `select()` can also exclude variables, using the `-` sign

.small[
```{r output.lines=18}
hotels %>%
  select(-agent) 
```
]

---

## `select()` a range of variables

- Instead of writing out all the variable names, `select()` also accepts a **range of variables** 

- This follows the order they are listed in the data frame

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel:arrival_date_month) 
```

---

## `select()` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(starts_with("arrival"))
```

---

## `select()` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(ends_with("type")) 
```

---

## Select helpers

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix
- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix
- `contains()`: Contains a literal string
- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
- `one_of()`: Matches variable names in a character vector
- `everything()`: Matches all variables
- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset
- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression (a sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string/pattern to be searched for within text)

.footnote[
See help for any of these functions for more info, e.g. `?everything`.
]

---

## `select()`, then `arrange()`

What if we wanted to select these columns, and then arrange the data in order of lead time?

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(lead_time)
```

---

## Pipes

In programming, a pipe is a technique for **passing information from one process to another**. In R, the symbol is `%>%`. Also: `|>`.

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `hotels`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
]
.pull-right[
.small[
```{r}
hotels %>% 
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(lead_time)
```
]
]

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `hotels`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
- then we select the variables `hotel` and `lead_time`,
]
.pull-right[
.small[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% #<<
  arrange(lead_time)
```
]
]

## Pipes

In programming, a pipe is a technique for **passing information from one process to another**. In R, the symbol is `%>%`. Also: `|>`.

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `hotels`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
- then we select the variables `hotel` and `lead_time`,
- and then we arrange the data frame by `lead_time`.
]
.pull-right[
.small[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% 
  arrange(lead_time) #<<
```
]
]

Note that the pipe operator is implemented in the package `magrittr`, but is automatically loaded when we use `library(dplyr)` or `library(tidyverse)`.

---

## How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following **sequence of actions** - find keys, start car, drive to work, park.

- Expressed as a set of **nested functions** in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "work"))
```

- Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "work") %>%
  park()
```

---
## Simple example
- We can write `exp(1)` with pipes as `1 %>% exp`, and `log(exp(1))` as `1 %>% exp %>% log`

```{r}
exp(1)
1 %>% exp
1 %>% exp %>% log
```

- Tidyverse functions are at their best when composed together using the pipe operator

---
## `arrange()` in ascending or descending order

- We saw earlier that `arrange()` defaults to ascending order

- For descending order, use `desc()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% 
  arrange(lead_time)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lead_time))
```
]

---

## `slice()` for certain row numbers

This is an alternative indexing option for `hotels[1:5, ]`

```{r output.lines=17}
hotels %>%
  slice(1:5) 
```


---

## Reminder: comments in R

- Any text following `#` will be printed as is, and won't be run as code

- This is useful for leaving comments and for temporarily disabling 
certain lines of code (for debugging, trying out different things)

.tiny[
```{r output.lines=5}
hotels %>%
  # slice the first five rows  # this line is a comment
  #select(hotel) %>%           # this one doesn't run
  slice(1:5)                   # this line runs
```
]

---

## `filter()` to select a subset of rows

.small[
```{r output.lines=17}
# bookings in City Hotels
hotels %>%
  filter(hotel == "City Hotel") 
```
]

<small>What was the base R alternative that we saw?</small>

---

## `filter()` for many conditions at once

```{r}
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     
    children >= 1    
    ) %>% 
  select(adults, babies, children)
```

---

## `filter()` for more complex conditions

```{r}
# bookings with no adults and some children or babies in the room
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     
    children >= 1 | babies >= 1   
    ) %>%
  select(adults, babies, children)
```

---

## Reminder: Logical operators in R

<br>

operator    | definition                   || operator     | definition
------------|------------------------------||--------------|----------------
`<`         | less than                    ||`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y` 
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        ||`is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`
`>`         | greater than                 ||`!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`
`>=`        |	greater than or equal to     ||`x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`
`==`        |	exactly equal to             ||`!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y`
`!=`        |	not equal to                 ||`!x`          | not `x`
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  ||              |



---
## `distinct()` to filter for unique rows

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(market_segment) 
```
]

.pull-left[
Recall: `arrange()` to order alphabetically
```{r}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(market_segment) %>%
  arrange(market_segment)
```
]
]

---
## `distinct()` using more than one variable 
```{r output.lines=13}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(hotel, market_segment) %>% #<<
  arrange(hotel, market_segment)
```


---
## `mutate()` to add a new variable

```{r}
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>% 
  select(children, babies, little_ones) %>%
  arrange(desc(little_ones))
```

<small>What are these functions doing? How do to the same in base R?</small>

---

## `count()` to create frequency tables

.pull-left[
```{r}
# alphabetical order by default
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
# descending frequency order
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment, 
        sort = TRUE) #<<
```
]

- Base R version: `table()`

---

## `count()` and `arrange()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
# ascending frequency order
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) %>%
  arrange(n) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# descending frequency order
# just like adding sort = TRUE
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) #<<
```
]

---

## `count()` for multiple variables

```{r}
hotels %>%
  count(hotel, market_segment) 
```

---

## `summarize()` for summary stats

```{r}
# mean average daily rate for all bookings
hotels %>%
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr)) 
```

- `summarize()` **changes the data frame** entirely

- **Rows are collapsed** into a single summary statistic

- **Columns that are irrelevant** to the calculation are **removed**


---
## `summarize()` is often used with `group_by()`

- For **grouped operations**

- There are **two types** of `hotel`, city and resort hotels

- We want the mean daily rate for bookings at **city vs. resort** hotels

```{r}
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>% 
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr))
```

- `group_by()` can be used with **more than one group**

---

## Multiple summary statistics

`summarize` can be used for multiple summary statistics as well

```{r}
hotels %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(), # frequencies
    min_adr = min(adr),
    mean_adr = mean(adr),
    median_adr = median(adr),
    max_adr = max(adr)
    )
```

---
## Data manipulation using `dplyr`

.pull-left[
```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarize`: reduce variables to values
- `group_by`: for grouped operations
- ... (many more)
]
]

## Exercise: NYC Flights data
This data frame contains data on all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013. It is available as part of the `nycflights13` package. 

```{r}
nycflights13::flights
```


---
## Exercise: NYC Flights data

Select the `carrier` column.

Select the `carrier` and `tailnum` columns.

Sort the data by origin.

Filter only flights with carrier `OO`.

Filter only flights with carrier `OO`, originating in `LGA`.

Create a new variable that indicates whether or not the flight departed late. 

Create a new variable for the mean departure delay by day.
```{r include = FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(meanDepDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Repeat all the operations using base R.
