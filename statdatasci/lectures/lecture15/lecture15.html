## Today

- Bayes' Theorem

- Random variables

  - Expectation and variance
  
  - Discrete and continuous random variables

---

## Bayes' Theorem

- Often we know `\(P(B|A)\)` when we really want `\(P(A|B)\)`

- For example, a 40-year-old woman has a positive screening mammogram.
    - `\(A\)` = cancer 
    - `\(B\)` = positive mammogram screening result.

--

- Using Bayes' Theorem is sometimes described as "updating our beliefs"
    - Without any information on the test result: the probability of cancer is `\(P(A)\)`. With test result we can calculate `\(P(A|B)\)`

- Want `\(P(A|B)\)`

&lt;!-- , which is the probability of having cancer given a positive screening result. --&gt;

--

- Need `\(P(A)\)`, the prevalance of breast cancer among 40-year-old women.

- Properties of screening tool: 
  - `\(P(B | A)\)`
  - `\(P(B | A^c)\)`
  - `\(P(B)\)`

&lt;!-- (called **sensitivity**, the probability of a positive result given that a person has cancer) --&gt;


---

## Bayes' Theorem

**Bayes' theorem** says that `\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}\)`. 

- The last equality is by the law of total probability

## Bayes' Theorem

`\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}\)`
 
- `\(A\)` = cancer, `\(B\)` = positive screening result.  

- Say `\(P(A) = .01\)`

- `\(P(B | A)= .85\)`

- `\(P(B|A^c) = .1\)` (probability of a positive screening result given that a person does not have cancer)

What is `\(P(A \mid B)\)`?

---

## Bayes' Theorem in Action

`\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}\)`

- `\(P(A) = .01\)`

- `\(P(B | A) = .85\)`

- `\(P(B|A^c) = .1\)`

- Then `\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{.85*.01}{.85*.01 + .1*(1 - .01)} = 0.079\)`

## Exercise

Edison Research gathered exit poll results from several sources for the Wisconsin recall election of Scott Walker. They found that 53% of the respondents voted in favor of Scott Walker. Additionally, they estimated that of those who did vote in favor for Scott Walker, 37% had a college degree, while 44% of those who voted against Scott Walker had a college degree. Suppose we randomly sampled a person who participated in the exit poll and found that he had a college degree. What is the probability that he voted in favor of Scott Walker?

---
## Random variables

- A random variable = mapping from possible outcomes in a sample space to a probability space. 

- Recall: **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes from a **random process**

]

- Let `\(X\)` be the random variable indicating whether a coin flip results in heads.

- Instead of saying `\(P(\texttt{heads})\)`, we say `\(P(X = 1)\)`

- This representation allows us to apply mathematical frameworks and get a better understanding of real-world phenomenon

---
## Random variables

- Denoted by capital letters, e.g., `\(X\)`, `\(Y\)`, `\(Z\)`

- A realization or draw of the random variable is denoted by a lowercase letter, `\(x\)`, `\(y\)`, `\(z\)`

--

- Other examples of random variables:

  - Mass of classroom chairs
  
  - Ages of students at UC Davis
  
--

- **Discrete** random variables:
  
  - Each outcome has an associated probability `\(P(X = x_i)\)` where `\(i = 1, ..., k\)` ( `\(k\)` outcomes are denoted by lower-case, `\(x_1, ..., x_k\)`)
  - Sometimes also written as `\(p_1, ..., p_k\)` 

---

## Expectation 

- Two books assigned: textbook and study guide. 

- 20% of students do not buy either book, 55% buy the textbook only, and 25% buy both books

- Say the class has 100 students. How many books should the bookstore expect to sell to the class? 

--

- How many books should the bookstore expect to sell per student?

- Intuitively: `\(.2*0 + .55*1 + .25*2 = 1.05\)` 


---
## Expectation 

- Let `\(X=\)` number of books sold per student 

- The three possible outcomes are `\(x_1\)` = 0 books, `\(x_2\)` = 1 book (1 textbook for each student), `\(x_3\)` = 2 books (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
`\(x_i\)` | 0 | 1 | 2
`\(P(X = x_i)\)` | .2 | .55 | .25

$$
`\begin{aligned}
E(X) &amp;= x_1 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$

- Using this definition: `\(E(X) = 0*.2 + 1* .55 + 2 * .25 = 1.05\)`.


---
## Expectation 

- Say we are interested in the **amount of revenue** that the bookstore can expect to earn per student. 

- The textbook costs $ 137 and the study guide costs $ 33.

- What modifications do we need? Before:

  - Let `\(X=\)` number of books sold per student

  - The three possible outcomes are `\(x_1\)` = 0 books, `\(x_2\)` = 1 books (1 textbook for each student), `\(x_3\)` = 2 books (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
`\(x_i\)` | 0 | 1 | 2
`\(P(X = x_i)\)` | .2 | .55 | .25

  - `\(E(X) = 0*.2 + 1* .55 + 2 * .25 = 1.05\)`.
  
---
## Expectation 

- Let `\(X=\)` revenue from books sold per student

- The three possible outcomes are `\(x_1\)` = $ 0, `\(x_2\)` = $ 137 (1 textbook for each student), `\(x_3\)` = $ 170 (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
`\(x_i\)` | 0 | 137 | 170
`\(P(X = x_i)\)` | .2 | .55 | .25


- Using this definition: `\(E(X) = 0*.2 + 137* .55 + 170 * .25 = 117.85\)`.
 
---
## Expectation 

- Denoted by `\(E(X)\)`, `\(\mu\)` or `\(\mu_x\)`

- **Expected or average outcome** of `\(X\)`, where `\(X\)` is a random variable 

--

- Given a probability distribution for a **discrete random variable**, we can calculate it using

$$
`\begin{aligned}
E(X) &amp;= x_1 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$

- Recall: this is a **population parameter**, a fixed quantity
  - The sample version, the **sample statistic**, is the sample mean `\(\bar{X}\)`

---
## Properties of the expectation 

- `\(E[c] = c\)`, where c is a constant

- `\(E[aX] = aE[X]\)`

- `\(E[aX + c] = aE[X] + c\)`

- To calculate `\(E(X^2)\)` (will be useful later), simply replace `\(x_i\)` in the sum by `\(x_i^2\)`, i.e., 

$$
`\begin{aligned}
E(X^2) &amp;= x_1^2 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$

- More generally, `\(E[g(X)] = \sum_{i=1}^k g(x_i) P(X = x_i)\)` (Law of the unconscious statistician)

---
## Variance

- Recall: we saw the **sample variance**, calculated for a data set

  - Take the square of deviations and find the mean
  
  - `\(s^2 = \frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + ... + (x_n - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}\)`

- **Population variance** is often denoted by `\(\sigma^2\)`, `\(\sigma_x^2\)`, or `\(Var(X)\)`

- Given a probability distribution for a discrete random variable, we can calculate it using

.small[
$$
`\begin{aligned}
Var(X) &amp;= E[(X-\mu)^2] \\
&amp;= (x_1 - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_1) + (x_2 - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + (x_k - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k (x_i - \mu)^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$
]

- Note: rather than summing over observations, these are over possible outcomes, weighted by their probabilities

---
## Variance

Another common way to write the variance is 
$$
`\begin{aligned}
Var(X) &amp;= E[(X-E(X))^2] \\
&amp;= E[ (X^2 - 2XE(X) + [E(X)]^2) ] \\
&amp;= E(X^2) - 2E(X)E(X) + [E(X)]^2 \\
&amp;= E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2
\end{aligned}`
$$

- Recall: `\(E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)\)`

- To calculate `\(E(X^2)\)`, simply replace `\(x_i\)` in the sum above by `\(x_i^2\)`, i.e., 

$$
`\begin{aligned}
E(X^2) &amp;= x_1^2 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$

---
## Properties of the variance 

- `\(Var[c] = 0\)`, where c is a constant

- `\(Var[aX] = a^2Var[X]\)`

- `\(Var[aX + c] = a^2Var[X]\)`

---
## Linear combinations of random variables

- Often we care not just about a single random variable, but a combination of them

- E.g., 

  - The total revenue of our bookstore is a combination of books from different classes, not just our one statistics class
  
  - The total gain or loss in a stock portfolio is the sum of the gains and losses in its components
  
  - Total weekly commute time is a combination of daily commute
  
 
---
## Linear combinations of random variables
 
- Let `\(W\)` be the weekly commute time per student at UC Davis

  - `\(X_1\)` = commute time per student on Monday
  - `\(X_2\)` = commute time per student on Tuesday
  - ...
  - `\(X_5\)` =  commute time per student on Friday
  - `\(W = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_5\)` is also a random variable
  

---
## Linear combinations of random variables
- A **linear combination** of two random variables, `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`, is of the form 
$$
aX + bY,
$$

where `\(a\)` and `\(b\)` are constants.

- `\(a\)` and `\(b\)` are also called coefficients

- In our example, `\(W = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_5\)` is a linear combination with coefficients 1. 

---
## Expectation of linear combinations of random variables

- The expectation for a linear combination of random variables is given by 
$$
E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)
$$

- In our example, say `\(E(X_1) = ... = E(X_5) = 21\)` minutes.

- Then, `\(E(W) = 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 = 105\)` minutes.  

---
## Variance of linear combinations of random variables

- The variance for a linear combination of **independent** random variables
$$
Var(aX + bY) = a^2 Var(X) + b^2 Var(Y)
$$

- **Note: this is only true if `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are independent**. 

--

- In our example, say `\(Var(X_1) = ... = Var(X_5) = 5\)` minutes. 

- Commute times on each day of the week are independent. 

- Then, `\(Var(W) = 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 = 25\)` minutes.  


---
## Exercise

A portfolio's value increases by 18% during a financial boom and by 9% during normal times. It decreases by 12% during a recession. What is the expected return on this portfolio if each scenario is equally likely?

---
## Exercise

Suppose we have independent observations `\(X_1\)` and `\(X_2\)` from a distribution with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`. What is the variance of the mean of the two values: `\(\frac{X_1 + X_2}{2}\)`?

--

Suppose we have 3 independent observations `\(X_1\)`, `\(X_2\)` and `\(X_3\)` from a distribution with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`. What is the variance of the mean of these 3 values: `\(\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3}{3}\)`?

--

Suppose we have n independent observations `\(X_1\)`, `\(X_2\)`, ..., `\(X_n\)` from a distribution with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`. What is the variance of the mean of these n values: `\(\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n}{n}\)`?
