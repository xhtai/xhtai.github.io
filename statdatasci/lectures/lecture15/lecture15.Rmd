## Today

- Bayes' Theorem

- Random variables

  - Expectation and variance
  
  - Discrete and continuous random variables

---

## Bayes' Theorem

- Often we know $P(B|A)$ when we really want $P(A|B)$

- For example, a 40-year-old woman has a positive screening mammogram.
    - $A$ = cancer 
    - $B$ = positive mammogram screening result.

--

- Using Bayes' Theorem is sometimes described as "updating our beliefs"
    - Without any information on the test result: the probability of cancer is $P(A)$. With test result we can calculate $P(A|B)$

- Want $P(A|B)$

<!-- , which is the probability of having cancer given a positive screening result. -->

--

- Need $P(A)$, the prevalance of breast cancer among 40-year-old women.

- Properties of screening tool: 
  - $P(B | A)$
  - $P(B | A^c)$
  - $P(B)$

<!-- (called **sensitivity**, the probability of a positive result given that a person has cancer) -->


---

## Bayes' Theorem

**Bayes' theorem** says that $P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}$. 

- The last equality is by the law of total probability

## Bayes' Theorem

$P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}$
 
- $A$ = cancer, $B$ = positive screening result.  

- Say $P(A) = .01$

- $P(B | A)= .85$

- $P(B|A^c) = .1$ (probability of a positive screening result given that a person does not have cancer)

What is $P(A \mid B)$?

---

## Bayes' Theorem in Action

$P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}$

- $P(A) = .01$

- $P(B | A) = .85$

- $P(B|A^c) = .1$

- Then $P(A \mid B) =\frac{.85*.01}{.85*.01 + .1*(1 - .01)} = 0.079$

## Exercise

Edison Research gathered exit poll results from several sources for the Wisconsin recall election of Scott Walker. They found that 53% of the respondents voted in favor of Scott Walker. Additionally, they estimated that of those who did vote in favor for Scott Walker, 37% had a college degree, while 44% of those who voted against Scott Walker had a college degree. Suppose we randomly sampled a person who participated in the exit poll and found that he had a college degree. What is the probability that he voted in favor of Scott Walker?

## Random variables

- A random variable = mapping from possible outcomes in a sample space to a probability space. 

- Recall: **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes from a **random process**

- Let $X$ be the random variable indicating whether a coin flip results in heads.

- Instead of saying $P(\texttt{heads})$, we say $P(X = 1)$

- This representation allows us to apply mathematical frameworks and get a better understanding of real-world phenomenon

---
## Random variables

- Denoted by capital letters, e.g., $X$, $Y$, $Z$

- A realization or draw of the random variable is denoted by a lowercase letter, $x$, $y$, $z$

--

- Other examples of random variables:

  - Mass of classroom chairs
  
  - Ages of students at UC Davis
  
--

- **Discrete** random variables:
  
  - Each outcome has an associated probability $P(X = x_i)$ where $i = 1, ..., k$ ( $k$ outcomes are denoted by lower-case, $x_1, ..., x_k$)
  - Sometimes also written as $p_1, ..., p_k$ 

---

## Expectation 

- Two books assigned: textbook and study guide. 

- 20% of students do not buy either book, 55% buy the textbook only, and 25% buy both books

- Say the class has 100 students. How many books should the bookstore expect to sell to the class? 

--

- How many books should the bookstore expect to sell per student?

- Intuitively: $.2*0 + .55*1 + .25*2 = 1.05$ 


---
## Expectation 

- Let $X=$ number of books sold per student 

- The three possible outcomes are $x_1$ = 0 books, $x_2$ = 1 book (1 textbook for each student), $x_3$ = 2 books (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
$x_i$ | 0 | 1 | 2
$P(X = x_i)$ | .2 | .55 | .25

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(X) &= x_1 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k \times P(X = x_k)\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

- Using this definition: $E(X) = 0*.2 + 1* .55 + 2 * .25 = 1.05$.


---
## Expectation 

- Say we are interested in the **amount of revenue** that the bookstore can expect to earn per student. 

- The textbook costs $ 137 and the study guide costs $ 33.

- What modifications do we need? Before:

  - Let $X=$ number of books sold per student

  - The three possible outcomes are $x_1$ = 0 books, $x_2$ = 1 books (1 textbook for each student), $x_3$ = 2 books (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
$x_i$ | 0 | 1 | 2
$P(X = x_i)$ | .2 | .55 | .25

  - $E(X) = 0*.2 + 1* .55 + 2 * .25 = 1.05$.
  
---
## Expectation 

- Let $X=$ revenue from books sold per student

- The three possible outcomes are $x_1$ = $ 0, $x_2$ = $ 137 (1 textbook for each student), $x_3$ = $ 170 (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
$x_i$ | 0 | 137 | 170
$P(X = x_i)$ | .2 | .55 | .25


- Using this definition: $E(X) = 0*.2 + 137* .55 + 170 * .25 = 117.85$.
 
---
## Expectation 

- Denoted by $E(X)$, $\mu$ or $\mu_x$

- **Expected or average outcome** of $X$, where $X$ is a random variable 

--

- Given a probability distribution for a **discrete random variable**, we can calculate it using

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(X) &= x_1 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k \times P(X = x_k)\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

- Recall: this is a **population parameter**, a fixed quantity
  - The sample version, the **sample statistic**, is the sample mean $\bar{X}$

---
## Properties of the expectation 

- $E[c] = c$, where c is a constant

- $E[aX] = aE[X]$

- $E[aX + c] = aE[X] + c$

- To calculate $E(X^2)$ (will be useful later), simply replace $x_i$ in the sum by $x_i^2$, i.e., 

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(X^2) &= x_1^2 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

- More generally, $E[g(X)] = \sum_{i=1}^k g(x_i) P(X = x_i)$ (Law of the unconscious statistician)

---
## Variance

- Recall: we saw the **sample variance**, calculated for a data set

  - Take the square of deviations and find the mean
  
  - $s^2 = \frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + ... + (x_n - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$

- **Population variance** is often denoted by $\sigma^2$, $\sigma_x^2$, or $Var(X)$

- Given a probability distribution for a discrete random variable, we can calculate it using

.small[
$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(X) &= E[(X-\mu)^2] \\
&= (x_1 - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_1) + (x_2 - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + (x_k - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^k (x_i - \mu)^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}
$$
]

- Note: rather than summing over observations, these are over possible outcomes, weighted by their probabilities

---
## Variance

Another common way to write the variance is 
$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(X) &= E[(X-E(X))^2] \\
&= E[ (X^2 - 2XE(X) + [E(X)]^2) ] \\
&= E(X^2) - 2E(X)E(X) + [E(X)]^2 \\
&= E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2
\end{aligned}
$$

- Recall: $E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)$

- To calculate $E(X^2)$, simply replace $x_i$ in the sum above by $x_i^2$, i.e., 

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(X^2) &= x_1^2 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

---
## Properties of the variance 

- $Var[c] = 0$, where c is a constant

- $Var[aX] = a^2Var[X]$

- $Var[aX + c] = a^2Var[X]$

---
## Linear combinations of random variables

- Often we care not just about a single random variable, but a combination of them

- E.g., 

  - The total revenue of our bookstore is a combination of books from different classes, not just our one statistics class
  
  - The total gain or loss in a stock portfolio is the sum of the gains and losses in its components
  
  - Total weekly commute time is a combination of daily commute
  
 
---
## Linear combinations of random variables
 
- Let $W$ be the weekly commute time per student at UC Davis

  - $X_1$ = commute time per student on Monday
  - $X_2$ = commute time per student on Tuesday
  - ...
  - $X_5$ =  commute time per student on Friday
  - $W = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_5$ is also a random variable
  

---
## Linear combinations of random variables
- A **linear combination** of two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, is of the form 
$$
aX + bY,
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants.

- $a$ and $b$ are also called coefficients

- In our example, $W = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_5$ is a linear combination with coefficients 1. 

---
## Expectation of linear combinations of random variables

- The expectation for a linear combination of random variables is given by 
$$
E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)
$$

- In our example, say $E(X_1) = ... = E(X_5) = 21$ minutes.

- Then, $E(W) = 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 = 105$ minutes.  

---
## Variance of linear combinations of random variables

- The variance for a linear combination of **independent** random variables
$$
Var(aX + bY) = a^2 Var(X) + b^2 Var(Y)
$$

- **Note: this is only true if $X$ and $Y$ are independent**. 

--

- In our example, say $Var(X_1) = ... = Var(X_5) = 5$ minutes. 

- Commute times on each day of the week are independent. 

- Then, $Var(W) = 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 = 25$ minutes.

## Exercise

A portfolio's value increases by 18% during a financial boom and by 9% during normal times. It decreases by 12% during a recession. What is the expected return on this portfolio if each scenario is equally likely?

---
## Exercise

Suppose we have independent observations $X_1$ and $X_2$ from a distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. What is the variance of the mean of the two values: $\frac{X_1 + X_2}{2}$?

--

Suppose we have 3 independent observations $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$ from a distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. What is the variance of the mean of these 3 values: $\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3}{3}$?

--

Suppose we have n independent observations $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_n$ from a distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. What is the variance of the mean of these n values: $\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n}{n}$?
