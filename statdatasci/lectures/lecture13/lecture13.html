- Statistical inference and probability theory

- Introduction to probability 

---

## Descriptive statistics
- Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to summarize and describe data

- Descriptive statistics do not necessarily generalize beyond the data 

- Can only be used to describe data set under study

- Example: An instructor wants to know how students in the class did on the last test
  - The instructor asks the 10 students sitting in the front row
  - This is the data
  - Does this generalize to the entire class?

---

## Descriptive statistics vs. inferential statistics
- Suppose the instructor randomly samples 10 people from the class and computes the sample mean

- Would we expect this sample mean to be exactly equal to the mean of all the students in the class, even if the sample was random?

- If the instructor takes another sample of 10 people from the class, would we expect the mean of this second sample to be equal to the mean of the first sample?

- **Inferential statistics** or **statistical inference** gives us an idea about how each of these sample means are likely to vary from each other and from the mean of all the students in the class

---
## Recall: Population vs. sample 
- A **sample** is a portion or **subset** of the larger **population**

- E.g., population may be UC Davis students; randomly sample 300 students on the Quad this morning

- **Population**: the entire group we would like to make conclusions about 

- **Sample**: specific group we have collected data from 

- Population **parameter**, e.g., population mean
  - This is a fixed quantity

- Sample **statistic**, e.g., sample mean
  - Depends on the sample 

---
## Statistical inference

- Statistical inference relies on the assumption that the data are drawn or sampled from some larger population

- Allows us to draw conclusions about the larger population

- This is one goal of statistics: to answer a question, by making **inferences** about a **population** based on data in one or more **samples**.

- The validity of our inferences depends on a variety of factors, including the **representativeness** of the sample

---

## Statistical inference

When a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter, it will be accompanied by a margin of error

## Statistical inference

- In order to draw principled conclusions from our data, we rely on a formal probabilistic framework that allows us to **quantify uncertainty**.

- **Statistical inference** is built upon the foundation of **probability theory**.

- Many topics in statistical inference

  - Fundamentals: probability, distributions, random variables, ...
  
  - Sampling 
  
  - Hypothesis testing
  
  - Point estimates and confidence intervals
  
  - Modeling: Linear regression, analysis of variance, nonparametric models, machine learning, ... 


---
## Probability

- The **probability** of an event tells us how likely an event is to occur, and it can take values from 0 to 1, inclusive. 

- Coin flipping: What is the chance of getting heads? 

- Die rolling: What is the chance of rolling a 1?

- Y chromosomes in the US population: 51.2% of births are to babies with Y chromosomes, and 48.8% of babies do not have Y chromosomes. Thus the probability of having a baby with a Y chromosome is 0.512.

---


## Formalizing Probability

- **Random process** gives rise to an **outcome** with an associated probability

  - Flip coin: heads or tails
  - Roll die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6
  
- The **probability** of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

- An outcome or set of outcomes are called **events**

- E.g., `\(A\)` is the event that a die roll results in 1 or 2
  - In set notation: `\(A = \{1, 2\}\)`


---

## Formalizing Probability

- A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes, often denoted by `\(\mathcal{S}\)`
  - Flipping a coin: {H, T}
  - Rolling a die: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  
- **Probability** is usually denoted by `\(p\)`, `\(P\)`, or `\(\mathbb{P}\)`, e.g., `\(\mathbb{P}(A) = 1\)`, where `\(A\)` is the event

- Always takes values between 0 and 1 (inclusive); sometimes represented as a percentage, e.g., 50%

- So we have `\(\mathbb{P}(\text{flipping H})= .5\)`

---


## Operations on Events

- The **union** of A and B, denoted `\(A \cup B\)`, is the event that A, or B, or both A and B, occur. E.g.,:
  - `\(A\)` is the event that a person smokes
  
  - `\(B\)` is the event that a person identifies as female
  
  - `\(A \cup B\)` is the event that a person is either a smoker, or identifies as female, or both.
  
  - "or" is inclusive, i.e., "and/or" in everyday language

- The **intersection** of A and B, denoted `\(A \cap B\)`, is the event that both A and B occur. Using the same example, 
  - `\(A \cap B\)` is the event that a person both smokes and identifies as female

---
## Venn Diagram

&lt;img src="img/VennDiagram_900.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- `\(A \cup B\)` includes both circles

- Will sometimes see a rectangle encapsulating the Venn diagram; this denotes the sample space

---

## Disjoint or mutually exclusive events 

- A and B are **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** if `\(A \cap B = \emptyset\)` 
  
  - A and B cannot occur simultaneously
  
  - Flipping heads and flipping tails are disjoint events 
  
  - Smoking and identifying as female are *not* disjoint; they can happen at the same time 

- The **complement** of A, denoted `\(A^c\)` or `\(\overline{A}\)`, is the event A does not occur. 

- In other words, `\(A^c\)` represents all outcomes in the sample space that are not in A

- `\(A\)` and `\(A^c\)` are **disjoint**. 

---

## Probability Rules

- The probability of any event in the sample space is between 0 and 1, inclusive.

- The probability of the entire sample space is 1.

- If we know the probability of `\(A\)`, often denoted `\(P(A)\)`, it is easy to calculate the probability of `\(A^c\)` as `\(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\)`. 

- This is called the **complement rule**:  `\(P(A) + P(A^c) = 1\)`.

---

## Additive Rule of Probability

- When events are mutually exclusive (cannot occur together), `\(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\)`. In a Venn diagram, the circles representing A and B do not intersect.

- When two events can occur simultaneously (think about the overlapping sections in the Venn diagrams), then we need to avoid double-counting when calculating the probability either of two events will occur.

- The general **additive rule of probability** is therefore `\(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\)` 

- `\(A \cap B\)` is part of the event A and part of the event B, we need to avoid double-counting it.

  - Note that if two events A and B are mutually exclusive, then `\(P(A \cap B) = 0\)`.

---

## Computing Probabilities

Intuitively, we can think of the probability of an outcome (or set of outcomes) as the proportion of times the outcome (or set of outcomes) would occur if we observed the random process infinitely many times.

If all the outcomes in our random process (sample space `\(\mathcal{S}\)`) are equally likely, then for some event `\(E\)`, `$$P(E)=\frac{\text{# of outcomes in } E}{\text{# of total outcomes in } \mathcal{S}}.$$`

- Rolling die: 
  - Let `\(A\)` be the event that we roll a 1 or a 6
  
  - `\(P(A) = \frac{2}{6}\)`

## Vaccine Hesitancy in the UK

&lt;img src="img/hesitancy.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We will consider this UK study on vaccine hesitancy, which explored hesitancy across a variety of UK ethnic groups.

The study collected information on 10,000 people. This was a sample in the original study, but for our purposes (to illustrate probability concepts) we are going to treat this as a population. 

---

## Vaccine Hesitancy


|Ethnicity|Vaccine Hesitant | Not Hesitant |
|:------|------:|-------:|
| White British or Irish | 1362 | 7368 |
| Other white background | 71 | 199 |
| Mixed | 55 | 115 |
| Asian or Asian British - Indian | 37 | 143 |
| Asian or Asian British - Pakistani/Bangladeshi | 85 | 115 |
| Asian or Asian British - other | 15 | 95 |
| Black or Black British | 136 | 54 |
| Other Ethnic Group or Not Specified | 31 | 119 |

---

## Practicing with Probabilities

Define events A = vaccine hesitant and B = Asian or Asian British-Indian. Calculate the following probabilities for a randomly-selected person from the 10,000 people

- `\(P(A)\)`

- `\(P(B)\)`

- `\(P(A \cap B)\)`

- `\(P(A \cup B)\)`

- `\(P(A \cup B^c)\)`

- A = vaccine hesitant; B = Asian or Asian British-Indian

- A = vaccine hesitant; B = Asian or Asian British-Indian
- `\(P(A) = \frac{1362 + 71 + 55 + 37 + 85 + 15 + 136 + 31}{10000} = \frac{1792}{10000} = .1792\)`

- `\(P(A \cap B) = \frac{37}{10000} = .0037\)`
- `\(P(A \cup B) = \frac{1362 + 71 + 55 + 37 + 85 + 15 + 136 + 31 + 143}{10000} = .1935\)`
- `\(P(A \cup {B^c}) = \frac{1792 + 7368 + 199 + 115 + 95+ 54 + 119}{10000} = .9875\)`
  - Or, `\(1 - \frac{143}{10000}\)`

## Probability distribution 

- A **probability distribution** is a table of all **disjoint** outcomes and their associated probabilities.

## Rules for Probability Distributions

A probability distribution is a list of the possible outcomes with corresponding probabilities that satisfies three rules:

1. The outcomes listed must be disjoint.

2. Each probability must be between 0 and 1.

3. The probabilities must total 1.

---

## Independence

- Events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are **independent** if knowing the outcome of one provides no useful information about the outcome of the other

- E.g.: Flipping a coin and rolling a die are two independent processes
  - Knowing the coin was heads does not help determine the outcome of a die roll

- Seeing someone with an umbrella and the day being rainy are not independent
  - If we see someone with an umbrella, it is more likely to be a rainy day 

---

## Independence

- What is the probability of flipping heads and rolling a 1 on a die? 

- Probability distribution

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 
--|--|-- |-- |-- |-- |--
Heads | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` 
Tails | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` 

- Intuition: 1/2 of the time we get heads, and 1/6 of those times we roll a 1

- Probabilities can therefore be multiplied

---

## Independence

- Multiplication rule for independent processes:

  - If A and B represent events from two different and independent processes, then the probability that both A and B occur can be calculated as the product of their separate probabilities: `\(P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)\)`.
  
  - If there are `\(k\)` events `\(A_1, ..., A_k\)` from `\(k\)` independent processes, then the probability they all occur is `\(P(A_1) \times P(A_2) \times ... \times P(A_k)\)`.
