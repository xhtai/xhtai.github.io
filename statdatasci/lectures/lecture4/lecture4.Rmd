## Named components

You can give names to elements or components of vectors

.small[
```{r}
x <- c(7, 8, 10, 45)
y <- c(-7, -8, -10, -45)
(names(x) <- c("v1", "v2", "v3", "fred"))
x[c("fred", "v1")]
x[c(4, 1)]
```
]

Note the labels are in what R prints; not actually part of the value

---
`names(x)` is just another vector (of characters):
```{r}
names(y) <- names(x)
sort(names(x))
which(names(x) == "fred")
```



---
## Arrays

- Many data structures in R are made by adding bells and whistles to vectors 

- **Arrays** are vectors with *dimensions*

- For example a two-dimensional array:

```{r}
x <- c(7, 8, 10, 45)
x.arr <- array(x, dim = c(2, 2))
x.arr
```

---
## Arrays

- Filled column-wise (by columns)

- `dim` says how many rows and columns

```{r}
dim(x.arr)
```
---

## Arrays with more than two dimensions
- Arrays can have three dimensions ( $r \times c \times h$; think about stacking $r \times c$ matrices)

- Can also have $4, 5, \ldots n$ dimensional arrays

- `dim` is a length $n$ vector
  - Says the size/number of indices of each component
  - e.g., a $4 \times 3$ array has `dim` length 2, elements are 4 and 3

.small[
```{r}
myArr <- array(1:12, dim = c(4, 3))
myArr
dim(myArr)
```
]

---

## Arrays with more than two dimensions
- A $4 \times 3 \times 2$ array has `dim` length 3, elements are 4, 3 and 2

```{r}
myArr <- array(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2))
myArr
```

---

## Arrays with more than two dimensions
- A $4 \times 3 \times 2$ array has `dim` length 3, elements are 4, 3 and 2

```{r}
dim(myArr)
```

Some other properties of the array:
```{r}
is.vector(myArr)
is.array(myArr)
```

---
```{r}
typeof(myArr)
str(myArr)
attributes(myArr)
```
`typeof()` returns the type of the _elements_

`str()` gives the **structure**: here, a numeric array, with three dimensions, size/indices, and then the actual numbers

---

## Arrays: Accessing and operating on arrays

Can access a 2-D array either by pairs of indices or by the underlying vector:
```{r}
x <- c(7, 8, 10, 45)
(x.arr <- array(x, dim = c(2, 2)))
x.arr[1, 2]
x.arr[3]
```
Remember that arrays are filled column-wise

---
## Arrays: Accessing and operating on arrays
Changing array values:
```{r}
x.arr
x.arr[3] <- 0
x.arr
```

---
## Arrays: Accessing and operating on arrays
Omitting an index means "all of it":
```{r}
x.arr[c(1:2), 2]
x.arr[, 2]
```

---
## Functions on arrays
Using a **vector-style function** on an array structure will go down to the underlying vector, *unless* the function is set up to handle arrays specially:
```{r}
which(x.arr > 9)
```

Many functions _do_ preserve array structure:
```{r}
y.arr <- -x.arr
y.arr + x.arr
```

---
Other functions specifically act on each row or column of the array separately:
```{r}
x.arr
rowSums(x.arr)
colSums(x.arr)
```

---
## Matrices
In R, a matrix is a specialization of a 2D array

```{r}
(myMat <- matrix(c(40, 1, 60, 3), nrow = 2))
is.array(myMat)
is.matrix(myMat)
```

Other arguments to `matrix()`:
- `ncol`
- `byrow = TRUE` to fill by rows.

---
## Matrices
- Element-wise operations with the usual arithmetic and comparison operators work
```{r}
myMat / 3
```

Compare whole matrices with `identical()` or `all.equal()`
```{r}
identical(myMat, x.arr)
```

---
## Matrix multiplication
Gets a special operator

```{r}
six.sevens <- matrix(rep(7, 6), ncol = 3)
six.sevens
myMat %*% six.sevens # [2x2] * [2x3]
```

<small>What happens if you try `six.sevens %*% myMat`?</small>

---
## Multiplying matrices and vectors
Numeric vectors can act like proper vectors:
```{r}
myVec <- c(10, 20)
myMat %*% myVec
myVec %*% myMat
```
<small>R silently casts the vector as either a row or a column matrix (to make the matrix multiplication operation make sense)</small>

---
## Other matrix operators

Transpose:
```{r}
t(myMat)
```

Determinant:
```{r}
det(myMat)
```

Diagonal:
The `diag()` function can extract the diagonal entries of a matrix:
```{r}
diag(myMat)
```

---
## Other matrix operators
Inverting a matrix:
```{r}
solve(myMat)
myMat %*% solve(myMat)
```

---
## Doing the same thing to each row or column
- We already saw this with arrays:
  - `rowSums()`, `colSums()` return the row and column sums
  - Also the mean: `rowMeans()`, `colMeans()`
  - Input is a matrix, output is a vector

```{r}
myMat; colMeans(myMat)
```

---
- `summary()`: vector-style summary of *column*
```{r}
myMat; summary(myMat)
```
---
`apply()`, takes 3 arguments, `X`, `MARGIN`, `FUN`
- `X`: the array or matrix
- `MARGIN`: 1 for rows and 2 for columns
- `FUN`: name of the function to apply to each

```{r}
rowMeans(myMat)
apply(myMat, 1, mean)
```

<small>What would `apply(myMat, 1, max)` do?</small>
---
## Lists
- Lists are a generic container
- Sequence of values, _not_ necessarily all of the same type

```{r}
my.distribution <- list("exponential", 7, FALSE)
my.distribution
```

- Most of what you can do with vectors you can also do with lists
- This is an unnamed list
---
## Lists
- Elements can be vectors of any type, or other data structures like matrices
- This is a named list

```{r}
l <- list(
  x = 1:4,
  y = c("hi", "hello", "jello"),
  z = matrix(c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE), nrow = 2)
)
l
```


---
## Lists
Make an empty list to fill in later
```{r}
myList <- vector(mode = "list", length = 4)
myList
```
---
## Accessing pieces of lists
Can use `[ ]` as with vectors  
or use `[[ ]]`, but only with a single index  
`[[ ]]` drops names and structures, `[ ]` does not

```{r}
l[1]
l[[1]]
```
<small>Does `l[[1:2]]` work?</small>


---
## Accessing pieces of lists
Helpful illustration from R for Data Science (Chapter 20.5.3):

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="110%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pepperShaker1.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="110%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pepperShaker2.png")
```
]
---
## Working with lists 
.pull-left[
```{r}
my.distribution
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
is.character(my.distribution)
is.character(my.distribution[[1]])
my.distribution[[2]]^2
```
]

<small>What happens if you try `my.distribution[2]^2`?</small>
<small>What happens if you try `[[ ]]` on a vector?</small>

---
## Filling in lists 
```{r}
myList[[1]] <- 1:10
myList
```
<small>What happens if you try `myList[1] <- 1:10`?</small>

---
## Expanding and contracting lists
Add to lists with `c()` (also works with vectors):
```{r}
my.distribution <- c(my.distribution, 7)
my.distribution
```

---
Chop off the end of a list by setting the length to something smaller (also works with vectors):
```{r}
length(my.distribution)
length(my.distribution) <- 3
my.distribution
```
