## Recap

--
- Lists (continued)
  - Names in lists
  - `lapply()`

- Data frames, or more generally "data sets"
  - Creating data frames
  - `tidyverse` and `dplyr`

- Exploratory data analysis
  - Some visualization examples
  - We might *manipulate or transform the data* before visualizing or calculating summary statistics

---
## Today
- Data manipulation tools 

---
## Visualization example 1: Mass vs. height in Star Wars data 

```{r fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = dplyr::starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)") +
  geom_point(data = starwars %>% filter(name == "Jabba Desilijic Tiure"), size = 5, pch = 1, color = "pink", stroke = 3)
```

---

## Visualization Example 2: Anscombe's quartet

```{r quartet-plot, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.asp = 0.4}
ggplot(Tmisc::quartet, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ set, ncol = 4)
```

---

## Visualization Example 3: Facebook visits
.question[ 
How are people reporting lower vs. higher values of FB visits?
]

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
load("./data/student_survey.rda")
ggplot(student_survey, aes(x = fb_visits_per_day)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "How many times do you go on Facebook per day?", 
    x = "Number of times", y = NULL
    )
```

---
## Data manipulation using `dplyr`

.pull-left[
```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarize`: reduce variables to values
- `group_by`: for grouped operations
- ... (many more)
]
]

As we go over the examples, think about how you would do these in base R

---

## Rules of `dplyr` functions

- First argument is always a data frame

- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

- Always return a data frame

- Don't modify in place
  - Meaning that you need an assignment operation if you want an "updated" version of the data frame 

---

## Data: Hotel bookings

- Data from two hotels: one resort and one city hotel

- Observations: Each row represents a hotel booking

- Goal for original data collection: Development of prediction models to classify a hotel booking's likelihood to be cancelled ([Antonia et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#bib5))

```{r message=FALSE}
hotels <- readr::read_csv("data/hotels.csv")
```

]

---

## First question: What is in the data set?

.tiny[
```{r output.lines=18}
dplyr::glimpse(hotels)
```
]
---

## `select()`: Select a single column

View only `lead_time` (number of days between booking and arrival date):

```{r}
select(hotels, lead_time)
```

- First argument: data frame we're working with , `hotels`
- Second argument: variable we want to select, `lead_time`
- Result: data frame with `r nrow(hotels)` rows and 1 column
- This is an alternative to `hotels$lead_time`
---

## Select multiple columns

View only the `hotel` type and `lead_time` columns:


```{r}
select(hotels, hotel, lead_time)
```

---
## `select()` to exclude variables

- We saw earlier that `select()` keeps variables
- `select()` can also exclude variables, using the `-` sign

.small[
```{r output.lines=18}
hotels %>%
  select(-agent) 
```
]

---

## `select()` a range of variables

- Instead of writing out all the variable names, `select()` also accepts a range of variables 

- This follows the order they are listed in the data frame

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel:arrival_date_month) 
```

---

## `select()` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(starts_with("arrival"))
```

---

## `select()` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(ends_with("type")) 
```

---

## Select helpers

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix
- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix
- `contains()`: Contains a literal string
- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
- `one_of()`: Matches variable names in a character vector
- `everything()`: Matches all variables
- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset
- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression (a sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string/pattern to be searched for within text)

.footnote[
See help for any of these functions for more info, e.g. `?everything`.
]

---

## `select()`, then `arrange()`

What if we wanted to select these columns, and then arrange the data in order of lead time?

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(lead_time)
```

---

## Pipes

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another. In R, the symbol is `%>%`

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `hotels`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
]
.pull-right[
.small[
```{r}
hotels %>% 
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(lead_time)
```
]
]

---

## Pipes

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `hotels`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
- then we select the variables `hotel` and `lead_time`,
]
.pull-right[
.small[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% #<<
  arrange(lead_time)
```
]
]

---

## Pipes

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `hotels`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
- then we select the variables `hotel` and `lead_time`,
- and then we arrange the data frame by `lead_time`.
]
.pull-right[
.small[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% 
  arrange(lead_time) #<<
```
]
]

Note that the pipe operator is implemented in the package `magrittr`, but is automatically loaded when we use `library(dplyr)` or `library(tidyverse)`.

---

## How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find keys, 
unlock car, start car, drive to work, park.

- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "work"))
```

- Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "work") %>%
  park()
```

---
## Simple example
- We can write `exp(1)` with pipes as `1 %>% exp`, and `log(exp(1))` as `1 %>% exp %>% log`

```{r}
exp(1)
1 %>% exp
1 %>% exp %>% log
```

- Tidyverse functions are at their best when composed together using the pipe operator

---
## `arrange()` in ascending or descending order

- We saw earlier that `arrange()` defaults to ascending order

- For descending order, use `desc()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% 
  arrange(lead_time)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lead_time))
```
]

---

## `slice()` for certain row numbers

This is an alternative indexing option for `hotels[1:5, ]`

```{r output.lines=17}
hotels %>%
  slice(1:5) 
```


---

## Reminder: comments in R

- Any text following `#` will be printed as is, and won't be run as code

- This is useful for leaving comments and for temporarily disabling 
certain lines of code (for debugging, trying out different things)

.tiny[
```{r output.lines=5}
hotels %>%
  # slice the first five rows  # this line is a comment
  #select(hotel) %>%           # this one doesn't run
  slice(1:5)                   # this line runs
```
]

---

## `filter()` to select a subset of rows

.small[
```{r output.lines=17}
# bookings in City Hotels
hotels %>%
  filter(hotel == "City Hotel") 
```
]

<small>What was the base R alternative that we saw?</small>

---

## `filter()` for many conditions at once

```{r}
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     
    children >= 1    
    ) %>% 
  select(adults, babies, children)
```

---

## `filter()` for more complex conditions

```{r}
# bookings with no adults and some children or babies in the room
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     
    children >= 1 | babies >= 1   
    ) %>%
  select(adults, babies, children)
```

---

## Reminder: Logical operators in R

<br>

operator    | definition                   || operator     | definition
------------|------------------------------||--------------|----------------
`<`         | less than                    ||`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y` 
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        ||`is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`
`>`         | greater than                 ||`!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`
`>=`        |	greater than or equal to     ||`x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`
`==`        |	exactly equal to             ||`!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y`
`!=`        |	not equal to                 ||`!x`          | not `x`
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  ||              |

---

## `mutate()` to add a new variable

```{r}
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>% 
  select(children, babies, little_ones) %>%
  arrange(desc(little_ones))
```

<small>What are these functions doing? How do to the same in base R?</small>

---

## `summarize()` for summary stats

```{r}
# mean average daily rate for all bookings
hotels %>%
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr)) 
```

- `summarize()` changes the data frame entirely

- Rows are collapsed into a single summary statistic

- Columns that are irrelevant to the calculation are removed


---
## `summarize()` is often used with `group_by()`

- For grouped operations

- There are two types of `hotel`, city and resort hotels

- We want the mean daily rate for bookings at city vs. resort hotels

```{r}
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>% 
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr))
```

- `group_by()` can be used with more than one group

---

## Multiple summary statistics

`summarize` can be used for multiple summary statistics as well

```{r}
hotels %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(), # frequencies
    min_adr = min(adr),
    mean_adr = mean(adr),
    median_adr = median(adr),
    max_adr = max(adr)
    )
```
