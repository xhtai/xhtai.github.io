## Today

- Common probability distributions: Normal

  - Standard normal distribution

  - R functions:
      - `dnorm()` for densities 
      - `pnorm()` for $P(X\leq x)$
      - `rnorm()` for random sample
      - `qnorm()` for quantiles (the value corresponding to an input probability, e.g., $P(X \leq \ ?) = p$)


---

## Recall: Continuous random variables

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/density.png")
```

- Probability distribution for a discrete random variable: **probability mass function**

- Continuous random variable: **probability density functions**

- For a continuous random variable, probability for any exact value is zero

- Instead, we think about probabilities in ranges. 

- $P(a \leq X \leq b)$ is the area under the density function between $a$ and $b$.

---
## Normal Distribution

- The **normal distribution** is an example of a continuous distribution

- It is a very important distribution and one of the primary inferential tools in statistics 

- Many **natural phenomenon** approximate the normal distribution, such as weight, height, blood pressure, annual rainfall

- Commonly called the *Gaussian distribution* after [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss)

- Also sometimes called a *bell curve*

---

## Illustration: Shoe sizes 

- Mickle et al (2010 *Footwear Science*) showed the following bimodal distribution of shoe sizes in the US. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bimodalshoes.png")
```

Note that standard shoe sizes are discrete.

---

## Illustration: Shoe sizes 

- Let $X$ represent the shoe size for wearers of men's shoes

- (Hypothetical) probability distribution of shoe sizes of wearers of men's shoes.

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(0)
x <- rnorm(10000, mean = 11, sd = 1.5)
x2 <- 2*x
xcat <- round(x2, digits = 0)
xdf <- data.frame(cbind(xcat = xcat / 2, x))
ggplot(data = xdf, aes(x = xcat)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count)/sum( after_stat(count) ) ) ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(x = "Shoe Size",
       y = "Probability",
       title = "US Men's Shoe Sizes")
```

---

## Illustration: Shoe sizes 

What is the probability of a customer wanting  a men's shoe size smaller than 9?


```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = xdf, aes(x = xcat)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = (after_stat(count))/sum(after_stat(count)))) + 
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(x = "Shoe Size",
       y = "Percent",
       title = "US Men's Shoe Sizes")
```


---

## Smaller Shoes

.pull-left[
```{r janitor,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(janitor)
distx <- xdf %>%
  tabyl(xcat) %>%
  select(-n) %>%
  rename(size = xcat,
         probability = percent)
distx[1:11, ]
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r janitor2,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
distx[12:22, ]
```
]

The probability of a random men's shoe wearer having a shoe size less than 9 in this population is `r sum(distx$probability[distx$size < 9])`.

What is the probability of shoe size 10-11.5?
---

## Moving to Continuous Distributions

- Now suppose we could get *really* well-fitting shoes, using quarter sizes (9, 9.25, 9.5, 9.75, ...) or even tenth sizes (9, 9.1, 9.2, ...), or shoes specifically made to fit your feet perfectly.

- As the number of sizes increases, the bar widths become narrower -> probability distribution of continuous random variable

.pull-left[
```{r normal, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(4, 18)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 10000, args = list(mean = 11, sd = 1.5)) + ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  labs (x = "Continuous Shoe Size",
        y = "Density")

```
]
.pull-right[
This is a **probability density function**.
]
---
## Moving to Continuous Distributions

- Probability density function can be used to get the probability of any range of continuous shoe sizes 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(4, 18)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                n = 10000,
                args = list(mean = 11, sd = 1.5)) +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm,
    args = list(mean = 11, sd = 1.5),
    xlim = c(4, 9),
    geom = "area",
    fill = "#003087",
    alpha = .3
  ) + labs(x = "Continuous Shoe Size")

```

E.g., probability of shoe size being less than 9 (shaded area)

---
## Moving to Continuous Distributions
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "40%"}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(4, 18)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                n = 10000,
                args = list(mean = 11, sd = 1.5)) +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm,
    args = list(mean = 11, sd = 1.5),
    xlim = c(4, 9),
    geom = "area",
    fill = "#003087",
    alpha = .3
  ) + labs(x = "Continuous Shoe Size")

```

- How do we find this area of interest?

- Calculus! $$P(a \leq X \leq b)=\text{area between a and b below the curve}=\int_a^b f(x)dx$$ where $f(x)$ represents the density curve
  - In this course, we will use R

---
## Normal Distribution

- **Symmetric, bell-shaped**

- Characterized by the mean, $\mu$, and the standard deviation, $\sigma$ (or variance, $\sigma^2$)

- For the normal distribution, the **density function** is given by  $$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}}$$

- Notation: $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$

- The normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 is called the **standard normal distribution**. It is commonly denoted $Z \sim N(0, 1)$. 

---
## Probability density function for Normal Distribution
- Like `dbinom()` and `dpois()`, `dnorm()` in R gives us the probability density function 

- Here instead of $P(X = x)$, it is the **value of the probability density function**, $f(x)$ on the previous slide, at values that we input

- `dnorm()` has arguments `x`, `mean` and `sd`, where `mean` and `sd` are the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution that we want

- **Remember that $P(X = x) = 0$ for a continuous random variable**; the value that `dnorm()` gives us is not a probability but the height of the density function

---
## Probability density function for Normal Distribution
```{r}
dnorm(x = -3:3, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

.small[
```{r}
data.frame(x = c(-3, 3)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Probability distribution of N(0, 1)",
       y = "f(x)")
```
]

---
## Normal Distribution varying mean 
- Which of the three distributions have means 0, 1, and 4?

```{r echo = FALSE}
myCols <- c("#420A68FF", "#DD513AFF", "#FCA50AFF")
data.frame(x = c(-3, 7)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1),
                geom = "area", 
                fill = myCols[1],
                alpha = .5) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = 1, sd = 1), 
                geom = "area", 
                fill = myCols[2],
                alpha = .5) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = 4, sd = 1), 
                geom = "area", 
                fill = myCols[3],
                alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Probability distribution of N(0, 1), N(1, 1), N(4, 1)",
       y = "f(x)")
```

---
## Normal Distribution varying standard deviation 
- Which has standard deviation 1, 2, and 4? 

```{r echo = FALSE}
data.frame(x = c(-15, 15)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                n = 10000,
                args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1),
                geom = "area", 
                fill = myCols[1],
                alpha = .5) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = 0, sd = 2), 
                geom = "area", 
                fill = myCols[2],
                alpha = .5) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = 0, sd = 4), 
                geom = "area", 
                fill = myCols[3],
                alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Probability distribution of N(0, 1), N(0, 4), N(0, 16)",
       y = "f(x)")
```

## Calculating probabilities for the normal distribution

- Recall `pbinom()`: $P(X \leq x)$ for  binomial 

- `pnorm()` for $P(X \leq x)$ for the normal distribution

- Arguments: 
  - `q`, "vector of quantiles" ( $x$ in $P(X \leq x)$ )
  - `mean`, $\mu$ (default value 0)
  - `sd`, standard deviation $\sigma$ (default value 1)

```{r}
pnorm(0)
```
---
## Back to shoes example

Men's shoe sizes follow a normal distribution with mean 11 and standard deviation 1.5, i.e., $N(\mu = 11,\sigma^2 = 1.5^2)$

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(4, 18)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                n = 10000,
                args = list(mean = 11, sd = 1.5)) +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm,
    args = list(mean = 11, sd = 1.5),
    xlim = c(4, 9),
    geom = "area",
    fill = "#003087",
    alpha = .3
  ) + labs(x = "Continuous Shoe Size")

```

E.g., probability of shoe size being less than 9 (shaded area)

- `rnorm()` 

- Arguments `n, mean, sd`

## Standard normal distribution

- Recall: $Z \sim N(0, 1)$

- Any normally distributed random variable can be expressed as a standard normal by **subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation**

- This process is called **standardization**

- $Y \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$

- $Z = \frac{Y - \mu}{\sigma}$

- $E\left(\frac{Y - \mu}{\sigma}\right) = \frac{1}{\sigma}[E(Y) - \mu] = 0$

- $Var\left(\frac{Y - \mu}{\sigma}\right) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}[Var(Y)] = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}[\sigma^2] = 1$

- **Moving the location** (mean moves to 0) and **changing the scale** (standard deviation becomes 1)

---
## More about the standard normal distribution

- Probability of shoe sizes smaller than 13:

.small[
```{r}
pnorm(13, mean = 11, sd = 1.5)
```
]

- Let $Y$ be the random variable denoting men's shoe sizes. Then $Y \sim N(11, 1.5^2)$.

.tiny[
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y \leq 13) &= P\left(\frac{Y - \mu_y}{\sigma_y} \leq \frac{13 - \mu_y}{\sigma_y} \right) \\
&=P\left( Z \leq \frac{13-11}{1.5} \right) \\
&=P(Z \leq \frac{2}{1.5})
\end{aligned}
$$
]
.small[
```{r}
pnorm(2/1.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
]

---
## z-score
.tiny[
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y \leq 13) &= P\left(\frac{Y - \mu_y}{\sigma_y} \leq \frac{13 - \mu_y}{\sigma_y} \right) \\
&=P\left( Z \leq \frac{13-11}{1.5} \right) \\
&=P(Z \leq \frac{2}{1.5})
\end{aligned}
$$
]

- Standardized value $\frac{13-11}{1.5}$ is a z-score

- $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{\text{value - mean}}{\text{standard deviation}}$

- **Number of standard deviations above (positive z-scores) or below the mean (negative z-scores)**


---
## z-score

.tiny[
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y \leq 13) &= P\left(\frac{Y - \mu_y}{\sigma_y} \leq \frac{13 - \mu_y}{\sigma_y} \right) \\
&=P\left( Z \leq \frac{13-11}{1.5} \right) \\
&=P(Z \leq \frac{2}{1.5})
\end{aligned}
$$
]

- $x - \mu$ is the number relative to the mean, e.g., shoe size 13 is 2 above the mean

- Dividing by $\sigma$: gives number of standard deviations above the mean

- e.g., shoe size distribution has sd = 1.5, so shoe size 13 is $\frac{2}{1.5} = 1.33$ standard deviations above the mean

- **Relative** positions stay the same, i.e., $P(Y \leq 13) = P(Z \leq \frac{2}{1.5})$ 

---
## Recall: Variance and standard deviation

- **Rules of thumb** for symmetric, bell-shaped distributions: 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean, respectively

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/sdRules.png")

```{r}
pnorm(2)

## Standardizing in R

Consider the samples we drew earlier from $N \sim (11, 1.5^2)$

.small[
```{r }
set.seed(0) # so results are reproducible 
normal3 <- rnorm(n = 5000, mean = 11, sd = 1.5) # shoe size distribution 
standardizedNormal3 <- (normal3 - 11)/1.5
```
]

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
data.frame(normal3) %>%
  rename(outcome = normal3) %>%
  bind_cols(dist = "original") %>%
  bind_rows(
    data.frame(standardizedNormal3) %>%
      rename(outcome = standardizedNormal3) %>%
      bind_cols(dist = "standardized")
  ) %>%

## Exercise

Assume that player ratings in chess tournaments follow a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution with mean 1600 and standard deviation 350. 

What common probability distribution do player ratings follow, and what are the parameters? 

--

A player with a rating of 2650 enters the tournament. What is the probability of a rating higher than this player? 

--

What is the probability of ratings between 1200 and 1800? 


---
## More about the standard normal distribution 

- We saw earlier that $P(Z \leq 0) = .5$. This is because the standard normal distribution is symmetric with mean 0.

```{r}
pnorm(0) # default value of mean = 0 and sd = 1
```

- Tail probabilities of the standard normal distribution 

  - The symmetry of the normal distribution allows us to calculate the probability of values falling in the tails
  
  - For any $z$-score, $P(Z \leq -z) = P(Z \geq z)$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/stdnorm5.png")
```

---
## Quantiles for the normal distribution 

- Quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals

- Recall: quartiles (four groups) and percentiles (100 groups)

- $P(X \leq q) = p$, where $q$ is the quantile (think of value on the horizontal axis), e.g., $P(Z \leq 0) = .5$

- Recall: `pnorm(q, mean, sd)` for $P(X\leq x)$, or $P(Z \leq z)$ for standard normal. `pnorm()` returns the probability, `p`

```{r}
pnorm(q = 0, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

- `qnorm(p, mean, sd)` for the quantile, e.g., $P(X \leq \ ?) = p$. `qnorm()` returns the quantile, `q`
  
```{r}
qnorm(p = .5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

---
## Important reference points for the normal distribution 

- z-scores (quantiles) corresponding to particular probabilities are often written as $z_p$
  - $p$ denotes the probability in the **right tail**, e.g., $z_{.025} \approx 1.96$

- Important reference points: 2.5% in the left and right tails 

- In R:

.pull-left[
```{r}
qnorm(.025, lower.tail = FALSE)
qnorm(.975)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/stdnorm5.png")
```
]
---
## Important reference points for the normal distribution 


.pull-left[
```{r}
pnorm(1.96)

## Summary: Distributions in R

- For each distribution, R has a family of commands, starting with the letters `d`, `p`, `q` and `r`
  - `d` for density
  - `p` for cumulative density up to input value $P(X \leq x)$. Think of $P(X \leq q) = p$
  - `q` for the quantile, e.g., $P(X \leq \ ?) = p$
  - `r` for a random sample from the distribution

## Summary

- Common probability distributions: Normal

  - Standard normal distribution

  - R functions:
      - `dnorm()` for densities 
      - `pnorm()` for $P(X\leq x)$
      - `rnorm()` for random sample
      - `qnorm()` for quantiles (the value corresponding to an input probability, e.g., $P(X \leq \ ?) = p$)
