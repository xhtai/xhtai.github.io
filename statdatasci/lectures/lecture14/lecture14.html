## Today

- Independence

- Conditional probability

- Marginal and joint probability 

- Revisiting independence

- Bayes' Theorem

---
## Independence

- Events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are **independent** if knowing the outcome of one provides **no useful information** about the outcome of the other

- E.g.: Flipping a coin and rolling a die are two independent processes
  - Knowing the coin was heads does not help determine the outcome of a die roll

- Seeing someone with an umbrella and the day being rainy are not independent
  - If we see someone with an umbrella, it is more likely to be a rainy day 

---

## Independence

- What is the probability of flipping heads and rolling a 1 on a die? 

- Probability distribution

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 
--|--|-- |-- |-- |-- |--
Heads | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` 
Tails | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` 

--

- Intuition: 1/2 of the time we get heads, and 1/6 of those times we roll a 1

- Probabilities can therefore be multiplied

---

## Independence

- Multiplication rule for **independent processes**:

  - A and B = events from **two different and independent processes**
  
      - `\(P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)\)`.
  
--

  - If there are `\(k\)` events `\(A_1, ..., A_k\)` from `\(k\)` independent processes, then the probability they all occur is `\(P(A_1) \times P(A_2) \times ... \times P(A_k)\)`.


---
## Conditional Probability

- Probabilty an event will occur **given that** another event has occured  

- E.g., instead of the **marginal** probability of contracting COVID:

  - The probability that someone will contract COVID **given that** they have been vaccinated
  
  - The probability someone will contract COVID **given that** they have not been vaccinated. 

--

- Earlier example: `\(A\)` = person smokes; `\(B\)` = identifies as female

  - Conditional probability that someone is a smoker (event `\(A\)`) given that they identify as female (event `\(B\)`) is denoted `\(P(A|B)\)`
  
      - "Probability of A given B"


---

## Simple Example

- Population = 3 female non-smokers, 1 female smoker, 4 non-female non-smokers, 4 non-female smokers.

.pull-left[

]

- Conditional probability someone is a smoker given that they identify as female, `\(P(\texttt{smoker}|\texttt{female})\)`
    
--
`\(= \frac{1}{3+1}\)`

- Change denominator to correspond to smaller population of interest

- How to read this off table / data? 


---
## Conditional probability: How to do this in R?

--

- Condition on `female` column, find proportion of smokers and non-smokers. 

- Recall: **column proportions**


```r
outTable &lt;- matrix(c(1, 3, 4, 4), nrow = 2)
rownames(outTable) &lt;- c("Smoker", "Non-smoker")
colnames(outTable) &lt;- c("Female", "Non-female")
prop.table(outTable, margin = 2)
```

```
##            Female Non-female
## Smoker       0.25        0.5
## Non-smoker   0.75        0.5
```


---
## Marginal probability 

- Each individual's characteristics:
.small[
``` 
   Female    Smoker
1       1         1
2       0         1
3       0         1
4       0         1
5       0         1
6       1         0
7       1         0
8       1         0
9       0         0
10      0         0
11      0         0
12      0         0
```
]

- **Marginal probability**: "unconditional" probability; based on a single variable
  
- One way to think about marginal probability: "throwing away/ignoring the other variable"

- `\(P(\texttt{female}) = \frac{4}{12}\)` (just look at female column)
  
- `\(P(\texttt{smoker}) = \frac{5}{12}\)` (just look at smoker column)


---
## Marginal probability

- Another way to think about marginal probability: **sum over the other variables** 
  - Might hear people say "marginalize over the other variable"

- Recall: row and column totals in R

.small[

```r
outTableTotals &lt;- outTable %&gt;%
  cbind(rowTotal = rowSums(outTable)) 
outTableTotals &lt;- outTableTotals %&gt;%
  rbind(columnTotal = colSums(outTableTotals))
outTableTotals
```

```
##             Female Non-female rowTotal
## Smoker           1          4        5
## Non-smoker       3          4        7
## columnTotal      4          8       12
```
]

- What do column totals sum over? How about row totals? 

--

- `\(P(\texttt{female}) =\)` 

- `\(P(\texttt{smoker}) =\)` 

---
## Joint probability

- For outcomes for **two or more** variables or processes

- E.g.:
  - Flipping a coin *and* rolling a die
  
  - Identifying as female *and* smoking

- `\(P(\texttt{smoker}\)` and `\(\texttt{female})\)`, `\(P(\texttt{smoker}, \texttt{female})\)`, `\(P(A \cap B)\)`


---
## Joint probability

- Divide frequencies by total count


```r
outTable / sum(outTable)
```

```
##                Female Non-female
## Smoker     0.08333333  0.3333333
## Non-smoker 0.25000000  0.3333333
```

- This is a **probability distribution**; should sum to 1

- The probabilities we saw in the previous class were joint and marginal probabilities 

---

## Recall Our Vaccine Hesitancy Example

|Ethnicity|Vaccine Hesitant | Not Hesitant |
|:------|------:|-------:|
| White British or Irish | 1362 | 7368 |
| Other white background | 71 | 199 |
| Mixed | 55 | 115 |
| Asian or Asian British - Indian | 37 | 143 |
| Asian or Asian British - Pakistani/Bangladeshi | 85 | 115 |
| Asian or Asian British - other | 15 | 95 |
| Black or Black British | 136 | 54 |
| Other Ethnic Group or Not Specified | 31 | 119 |


---

## Three Probabilities

Define events A=vaccine hesitant and B=Asian or Asian British-Indian. Calculate the following probabilities for a randomly-selected person drawn from the population of 10,000. 

- **Marginal probability** of vaccine hesitancy, `\(P(A) = \frac{1362 + 71 + 55 + 37 + 85 + 15 + 136 + 31}{10000} = \frac{1792}{10000}\)`

- **Joint probability** of vaccine hesitancy and Indian ethnicity, `\(P(A \cap B) = \frac{37}{10000}\)`

- **Conditional probability** of vaccine hesitancy given a person is of Indian ethnicity, `\(P(A \mid B)\)`

--
`\(= \frac{37}{37+143}\)`

---

## Rules for Conditional Probability

- **Conditional probability** `\(P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\)`

- Recall: Conditional probability someone is a smoker given that they identify as female = `\(P(\texttt{smoker}|\texttt{female}) = \frac{1}{3+1}\)`

  - Calculated by changing the denominator to correspond to our smaller population of interest 
  
  - `\(= \frac{\# (\texttt{smoker and female})}{\# \texttt{female}}\)` 

- According to new formula: `\(P(\texttt{smoker}|\texttt{female}) = \frac{P(\texttt{smoker} \cap \texttt{female})}{P(\texttt{female})} = \frac{\# \texttt{smoker and female}/\texttt{total}}{\# \texttt{female}/\texttt{total}}\)`

- Works because total cancels out

---

## Rules for Conditional Probability

- `\(P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\)`

- **General multiplication rule**: `\(P(A \cap B) = P(B)P(A|B)\)`.


.small[
| Female | Non-female 
--|-- | -- 
Smoke |  1 | 4
Does not smoke |3 | 4
]


- `\(P(\texttt{smoker and female}) = P(\texttt{female})P(\texttt{smoker}|\texttt{female})\)`

---

## Rules for Conditional Probability

- **Sum of conditional probabilities**: 

Let `\(A_1, ..., A_k\)` be disjoint outcomes. Then `\(P(A_1|B) + ... + P(A_k| B) = 1\)`

  - Same idea as complement rule: `\(P(A) + P(A^c) = 1\)`.


- Two events, `\(A\)` and `\(A^c\)`

  - `\(P(A|B) + P(A^c| B) = 1\)`

  - Conditional version of complement rule 
  
  - `\(P(A|B) = 1 - P(A^c| B)\)`

---

## Rules for Conditional Probability

- **Law of total probability**:

- `\(P(B)=P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid {A}^c)P({A}^c) = P(B \cap A)+P(B \cap {A}^c)\)`

  - What is this in words? 

  &lt;!-- - Translates to the statement that the probability that B occurs is equal to the sum of the probabilities that B occurs with A and that B occurs without A --&gt;

- Extending this to `\(A_1, ..., A_k\)`, where `\(A_1, ..., A_k\)` are disjoint outcomes: `\(P(B) = P(B \cap A_1)+ ... + P(B \cap {A_k})\)`


---

## Revisiting Independence

- Recall: If events A and B are independent, then `\(P(A \cap B)=P(A)\times P(B).\)`

  - Knowing the outcome of one does not provide information about the other

  - Rolling die and coin toss example 

- Another way to check this is using conditional probability

---

## Revisiting Independence

- Recall this probability distribution:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 
--|--|-- |-- |-- |-- |--
Heads | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` 
Tails | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{12}\)` 

- `\(P(\texttt{roll 1} | \texttt{heads}) = \frac{P(\texttt{1 and heads})}{P(\texttt{heads})} = \frac{1/12}{1/2} = 1/6\)`

- `\(P(\texttt{roll 1}) = 1/6\)`

- Events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are **independent** if and only if `\(P(A \mid B)=P(A)\)` and `\(P(B \mid A)=P(B)\)`.

---

## Revisiting Independence

- Events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are **independent** if and only if `\(P(A \mid B)=P(A)\)` and `\(P(B \mid A)=P(B)\)`.

  - This comes from the multiplication rule `\(P(A \cap B)=P(A)\times P(B)\)` and the definition of conditional probability, `\(P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\)`
  
  - `\(P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A) P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)\)`

  - `\(P(B|A)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(A) P(B)}{P(A)} = P(B)\)`
  
---

## Checking Independence

Are vaccine hesitancy and Indian ethnicity independent in our population?

- **Marginal probability** of vaccine hesitancy, `\(P(A) = \frac{1362 + 71 + 55 + 37 + 85 + 15 + 136 + 31}{10000} = \frac{1792}{10000} = .1792\)`

- **Conditional probability** of vaccine hesitancy given a person is of Indian ethnicity, `\(P(A \mid B) = \frac{37}{37+143} = .206\)`

- `\(P(A) = P(A \mid B)\)`? Independent?  

---

## Independent vs Disjoint Events

- For **independent events** `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`, `\(P(A \mid B)=P(A)\)` and `\(P(B \mid A)=P(B)\)`, so knowing one event occurred tells us *nothing* about the chances the other event will occur.

- For two **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** events, knowing that one event has occurred tells us that the other event definitely has not occurred, i.e., `\(P(A \cap B)=0\)`.

- Disjoint events are therefore *not* independent!


---

## Bayes' Theorem

- Often we know `\(P(B|A)\)` when we really want `\(P(A|B)\)`

- For example, a 40-year-old woman has a positive screening mammogram. Let the event `\(A\)` be having cancer and `\(B\)` be the positive mammogram screening result. 

--

- Using Bayes' Theorem is sometimes described as "updating our beliefs"
    - Without any information on the test result: the probability of cancer is `\(P(A)\)`. With test result we can calculate `\(P(A|B)\)`

- Want `\(P(A|B)\)`

&lt;!-- , which is the probability of having cancer given a positive screening result.  --&gt;

--

- Need `\(P(A)\)`, the prevalance of breast cancer among 40-year-old women.

- Properties of screening tool: 
  - `\(P(B | A)\)`
  - `\(P(B | A^c)\)`
  - `\(P(B)\)`

&lt;!-- (called **sensitivity**, the probability of a positive result given that a person has cancer) --&gt;




---

## Bayes' Theorem

**Bayes' theorem** says that `\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}\)`. 

- The last equality is by the law of total probability

## Bayes' Theorem

`\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}\)`
 
- `\(A\)` = cancer, `\(B\)` = positive screening result.  

- Say `\(P(A) = .01\)`

- `\(P(B | A)= .85\)`

- `\(P(B|A^c) = .1\)` (probability of a positive screening result given that a person does not have cancer)

What is `\(P(A \mid B)\)`?

---

## Bayes' Theorem in Action

`\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}\)`

- `\(P(A) = .01\)`

- `\(P(B | A) = .85\)`

- `\(P(B|A^c) = .1\)`

- Then `\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{.85*.01}{.85*.01 + .1*(1 - .01)} = 0.079\)`
